# UFOs


Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth assessment of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

Results: 

After adding additional table filters a user can search for information based on a specific city, state, country, and shape. 

For example if you would like to pull information for the state of Arizona you would type that state and the table will filter the data to show you the results for that state only.

Summary: 

In general we created a very nice website with multiple filters and interesting information.
One drawback the website is a bit plain. 
A couple of things that I would add are
- Make the website mobile-friendly. These days a lot of people browse on their phones;
- Add a good Error 404 page. When a user lands on a 404 it should provide them with the option to get back on track.
